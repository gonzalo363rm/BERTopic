The code and results for the experiments in [BERTopic: Neural topic modeling with a class-based TF-IDF procedure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05794). 
The results for Table 1 and 2 can be found in `results/Basic/`. The results for Table 3 can be found in `results/Dynamic Topic Modeling`. 

To run the experiments, you can follow along with the tutorial in `notebooks/Evaluation.ipynb`. 
To visualize the results from the paper, use `notebooks/Results.ipynb`.
